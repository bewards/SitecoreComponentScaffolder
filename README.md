# SitecoreComponentScaffolder
A scaffolding template built with Plop.js to quickly spin up a Sitecore Component based on scaffolding questions.

A scaffolding tool is a beneficial way of kickstarting the creation of a Feature, such as a Sitecore Component, while providing guard rails and best practices for the Project at hand. This scaffolding tool is intended to act as a starting point for all Sitecore component scaffolding needs and can be dropped into your rendering host application.

✅ Pre-determined sample questions built within the plopfile.mjs file. <br/>
✅ Handlebars templating logic with conditions for building out the file based on Plop responses<br/>
✅ Select from a dynamic list of existing project Feature choices or create a new Feature<br/>
✅ Powerful Plop question types such as input, confirm, and list<br/>
